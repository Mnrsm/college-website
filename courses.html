            <h3>Computer Science</h3><br><p>The Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) was set up in 1983 with B.E. programme. Since then, the department has grown exponentially over the years on all fronts in terms of infrastructure, courses and faculty. The department has Nine computer centres with around 300 computers equipped with the latest hardware, software and peripherals. A new feather in the cap is the recently established state-of-the-art IBM OpenPower lab which delivers unparalleled performance for analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and modern High-Performance Computer (HiPC).  The department hosts campus-wide networking facility with 10 servers (including high-end ones), an Internet laboratory housing 60 computers with a dedicated leased line connectivity of 250 Mbps (wired and wireless) and a well-stocked library.

                Students receive offers through placements/internships from reputed companies such as Cisco, HP, Intuit, Microsoft R&D, Walmart, Deloitte, Dell, Morgan Stanley and several others. Part of one of the best Engineering colleges in the country, the department was among the first two of their kind in Karnataka to be recognised as a Doctoral-level Research Centre by Visveswaraya Technological University (VTU). Qualified professors serve as research guides under whom 17 candidates have been awarded PhD and 23 research scholars are pursuing PhD. The current faculty strength is 33 which includes 5 Professors, 6 Associate Professors, 18 Assistant Professors, faculty for English, Constitution and Professional Ethics.

The department is also the recipient of a World Bank grant under Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP) and utilizes the funds to enhance department facilities and develop faculty.</p>
            <h3>Electrical</h3><br><p>The Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering established in the year 1958 with Bachelor’s degree in “Electrical & Electronics Engineering”, is one of the first few departments at The National Institute of Engineering, Mysuru. The department made a humble beginning in 1958 with only four staff members and two laboratories housed in an area of about 900 sq. mts. In the silver jubilee year of the institute in 1971, a postgraduate programme leading to master’s degree in “Power Systems” was started. In the year 1987, the department was recognized as research centre to carry out Ph.D programme. Further in the golden jubilee year of the institute in 1996, another postgraduate programme titled “Computer Applications in Industrial Drives” was started. 

                In the year 2002, the department established a centre of excellence “Centre for Energy Management and Test Systems for Electrical Apparatus” (CEMATEA), authorized by electrical inspectorate, Government of Karnataka to carryout periodical testing of various electrical installations in industries and other organizations in and around Mysuru. </p>
            <h3>Mechanical</h3><br><p>The Department of Mechanical Engineering (ME) established in 1958 has created creditable milestones, enabled success stories for its faculty and students alike, and partnered with industry and academia to innovate for social impact.

                An NBA Tier-1 programme and ‘Research Centre’ recognised by the Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), the department has forged industry collaborations with leading automation companies such as Bosch-Rexroth, Felsomat, Fanuc, Festo, Siemens and Christiani. Its gender diversity focus has yielded internship and placement opportunities for girl students with Mercedes Benz. Its 14 well-equipped laboratories, and 8 Centres of Excellence have spawned innovations that go beyond prototypes to become real world solutions — hub for motor sports teams, turnkey projects in rainwater harvesting for Mysuru palace, and a bio-gasification plant for Mysuru zoo to name a few. MoUs with National Entrepreneurship Network (NEN) and MSME Development Institute foster entrepreneurship and business skill development.
                
                A highly-qualified and erudite faculty with several patents and publications to its credit nurture students to achieve excellence. For an exciting future on the edge of technology, this is the place to be!</p>
